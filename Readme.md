# Express
      
  Insanely fast (and small) server-side JavaScript web development framework
  built on **node.js** and the **V8 JavaScript engine**.

  * Stay tuned, coming soon :)

## Features (so far)

  * Sexy DSL
  * Mime helpers
  * Nested parameter parsing
  * Full test coverage
  * Test helpers (mock requests etc)
  * Cookie support
  * Session support
  * Faux method support for RESTful apps
  * Extendable using Express 'Modules'
  * Static file serving
  * View support
  * Routing
    * string matching       
    * regexp with captures  
    * param key substitution
    * pre-conditions
    * overidding
    * etc

## Performance

  Extensive benchmarking will wait until a development version
  has been released. However for simple an average route and response
  body Ruby's Sinatra scored **1454** request per second using Thin, while
  Express scored **2762**.

## Examples

See examples/simple.js for a working server that uses a synchronous handler. 
Just type "node examples/simple.js" and then go to http://localhost:3000/i/like/cheese

For an asynchronous example, run "node examples/async.js" and then go to http://localhost:3000/wait/2000

GET /user/tj/edit
  
    get('user/:name/:operation', function(){
      param('operation') + 'ing ' + param('name')
    })

GET /articles
  
    get('articles', function(){
      'list of articles'
    })

GET /articles/12
  
    get(/articles\/(\d+)/, function(){
      'article id ' + captures[1]
    })
  
POST /user/:id
  
    post('user/:id', function(){
      User.destroy(params('id')) ? 
        'User deleted' :
          'Failed to delete user'
    })
  
GET /login
  
    get('login', function() {
      '<form method="post" action="/login">        \
      <input type="text" name="user[name]" />      \
      <input type="password" name="user[pass]" />  \
      <input type="submit" value="Login"/>         \
      </form>'
    })
  
POST /login
    
    post('login', function() {
      'Welcome ' + param('user').name
    })
  
## Settings

    * basepath         : defaults to '/'
    * defaultRoute     : responds with page not found
    * mime.defaultType : defaults to 'application/octet-stream'
    * cookie.maxAge    : defaults to 3600 milliseconds
    
## Public API

  * Coming Soon
  
## Running Tests

Express uses the [JSpec](http://jspec.info) BDD JavaScript testing
framework to write and run elegant spec suites. JSpec is froozen 
to spec/lib and does not require seperate installation.

To run all specifications:

    $ make test
    
Run individual suites:

    $ node spec/spec.node.js core
    $ node spec/spec.node.js mime
    $ node spec/spec.node.js routing
    ...
